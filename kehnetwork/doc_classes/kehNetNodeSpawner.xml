		Base class for node spawners.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		During the replication, the network system will most likely need to spawn nodes representing the various entities within the game world.
		To help with this task node spawners can be registered within the network system. Those spawners must be classes derived from this one.
		A derived class must implement a function named [i]spawn()[/i] and it must return the spawned node.
